# Code4ChangeProject
This project was a visual and functional representation of an environmental solution, I created this project based on the 2030 agenda of the UN.

# About The Project
<h3>What's the matter?</h3>
<p>It is a matter of consenting to the
                    pollution caused by solid waste and the inefficient
                    and the inefficient use of plastic in disposal.

                    The plastic we use can be put to more efficient uses, and one of them is
                    creating eco-friendly plastic bricks to build houses for the homeless.
                    houses for the homeless.

                    Social media can change society,
                    because let's face it, young people right now, many of them are very young.
                    are influenced by social networks or directly by what they find relevant and they pay more attention
                    to it.
                    They are influenced by social networks or directly by what seems relevant to them and they pay more
                    attention to it than to something that appears in a newspaper.

                    With this we can know that a simple post on the internet can change things, so why not use it in the
                    right way?

                    That's why I have created this application, to simulate a situation
                    situation where you start recycling and you have the possibility to upload a post related to the
                    related to the consent of contamination, which can make more people recycling the same
                    that there are more people recycling the same as you, and you can recycle more per day,
                    because there are more people recycling the same as you and donating.
